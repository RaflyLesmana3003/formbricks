#### Integrations

# Google Tag Manager

The Google Tag Manager integration allows you to track the traffic of your survey and use it as a detailed insight metric.

<Note>
  This feature is enabled by default in both Formbricks Cloud and the self-hosted version.
</Note>

## Get Your Google Tag ID (Container ID)

1. Go to the [Google Tag Manager website](https://tagmanager.google.com/) to get your GTM ID (Container ID). If you don't have a Tag Manager account, you will need to create one.

  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

2. Go to the Formbricks integration tab and select **Google Tag Manager**.

  alt="Formbricks Integration Page"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

3. You will see a new page. Since you don't have any tags yet, add a new one by clicking **Add New Tag**.

<MdxImage
  src={AddNewTag}
  alt="Add New Tag"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

<Note>
  Before proceeding to the next step, ensure that you have a Formbricks Survey with at least one question.
</Note>

4. Fill in the details and click **Save**.

  src={SaveTag}
  alt="Google Tag Modal"
  quality="100"
  className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
/>

Congratulations! You have successfully added a Google Tag to your survey. Now, whenever someone interacts with your survey, an event will be sent to your Tag Manager account.

1. Visit the Integrations tab in your Formbricks dashboard.
